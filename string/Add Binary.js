            sum += parseInt(a[i--]); // convert string to number using parseInt function. why a[i--]? because we are iterating from the end of the string to the start. So basically we are hust converting the string to number and adding it to the sum.

}

// After potentially adding the bits from a and b to sum, the remainder of sum divided by 2 (which will be either 0 or 1) is prepended to result. This is because in binary addition, if the sum is 2, the result bit is 0 and a carry of 1 is generated. If the sum is 1 or 0, the result bit is 1 or 0 respectively, with no carry. 
// The carry for the next iteration is then calculated as the floor of sum divided by 2. This will be 1 if sum was 2, and 0 otherwise.
